# tic-tac-toe
an attempt to make a playable version of tic tac toe in the command line

The game is completed. The minimax algorithm is completed without any optimization methods as there was no performance issues.
This project taught me good use of vscode debugging, solidifed my python skills and improved my git usage.
I origonally started the game with the game board as a dictionary but this caused dificulty implementing the minimax algorithm
i then changed the game board to a list of lists and improved game functionality.

the game gives the user the option to play against the computer or a friend
difficulties in this were certain bug fixes would break the other game (competer game bug fix breaks friend game functionality and vice versa) as the project went on I found ways to solve bugs in one game mode that wouldnt affect the other mode.

my biggest take away from doing this project is proper code commenting. coming back to a section after 24 hours can have issues let alone months or years later in larger projects. i put effort in to describe all my code in comments and it made it far easier to debug.
